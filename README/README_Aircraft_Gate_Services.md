# Aircraft Gate Services
## Agentic AI Network – README

> **Configuration file:** `aircraft_gate_services.hocon` (uploaded as `aircraft_gate_services__1_.hocon`)
> **Implementation file:** `aircraft_gate_services.py`
> **Framework:** neuro-san (aaosa)
> **Primary use case:** Aggregation router for gate-phase turnaround operations — routes to gate assignment (BRANCH A) or deplaning equipment connection (BRANCH B: jetbridge or stairtruck) based on an `instruction` field.

---

## 1. Overview

`aircraft_gate_services` is one of the four aggregation networks called directly by `aircraft_turnaround_manager`. It handles the two gate-related steps in the turnaround sequence — STEP 3 (gate assignment) and STEP 9 (deplaning equipment connection). Each call executes exactly one branch determined by an `instruction` field or a gate_id presence check.

The network combines:
- `gate_crew_agent` — a single LLM routing agent with two branches and three sub-paths
- `TrackerAPI` — standard sly_data-first coded state manager
- Three external leaf networks resolved from `registries/aaosa_basic.hocon`

No prior documentation existed for this network; this README is built entirely from source.

> **Note on filename:** The uploaded HOCON file is named `aircraft_gate_services__1_.hocon` (with `__1_` suffix). This is likely a versioning or download artifact. The actual deployed filename in the registry is `aircraft_gate_services.hocon`.

> **Note on task title:** The task prompt requested `README_Aircraft_Ground_Traffic.md` — this appears to be an error. The uploaded files are for `aircraft_gate_services`. This README is correctly titled for the gate services network.

## 5. Components

### 5.1 gate_crew_agent (LLM Router)

The single entry-point agent. It checks the `instruction` field first, then falls back to inquiry text to determine which branch executes.

> Note: The agent description contains a typo: `"I am responsibke for gate assignment"` — should be `"responsible"`.

#### Input parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| `aircraft_type` | string | ✅ | Aircraft model/type |
| `flight_number` | string | ✅ | Flight identifier |
| `flight_status` | string | ❌ | Current flight status |
| `gate_id` | string | ❌ | Assigned gate (null triggers BRANCH A) |
| `instruction` | string | ❌ | **Primary routing discriminant** |
| `deplaning_equipment_type` | string | ❌ | `jetway` or `stairtruck` — required for BRANCH B routing |
| `acu_connection_status` | string | ❌ | Required by STEP 2A/2B |
| `gpu_connection_status` | string | ❌ | Required by STEP 2A/2B |
| `wheelchocks_installation_status` | string | ❌ | Required by STEP 2A/2B |
| `jetbridge_connection_status` | string | ❌ | Output of STEP 2A |
| `stairtruck_connection_status` | string | ❌ | Output of STEP 2B |
| `deplaning_equipment_id` | string | ❌ | Equipment identifier at gate |

#### Routing logic

The agent reads the `instruction` field **before** reading the inquiry text:

| Condition | Branch triggered |
|---|---|
| `instruction` absent/null AND `gate_id` is null | **BRANCH A** |
| `instruction` contains `'assign'`, `'gate'`, or `'select'` | **BRANCH A** |
| `gate_id` already set in args | Skip to **BRANCH B** |
| `instruction` contains `'jetbridge'` or `'jet bridge'` | **BRANCH B → STEP 2A** |
| `instruction` contains `'stairtruck'` or `'stair'` | **BRANCH B → STEP 2B** |
| `instruction` contains `'connect'` or `'deplaning'` | **BRANCH B** (equipment type determines 2A/2B) |
| Inquiry asks to connect jetbridge or stairtruck | **BRANCH B** |

---

#### BRANCH A — Gate assignment

**Trigger:** Called as STEP 3 by `aircraft_turnaround_manager` with no `instruction` and no `gate_id`.

**STEP 1 — Execute gate assignment:**
Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_gate_selection` with `flight_number`, `aircraft_type`. Wait. Extract: `gate_id`, `deplaning_equipment_type`, `deplaning_equipment_id`, `deplaning_equipment_readiness_time`, `deplaning_equipment_score`. Call `TrackerAPI` to store `gate_id` and `deplaning_equipment_type`.

> Note: The instruction says to extract `deplaning_equipment_readiness_time` and `deplaning_equipment_score` but these fields are not in the Python `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS` and are not tracked by TrackerAPI. They appear in the summary template but will not be persisted in sly_data.

**STEP 2 — RETURN SUMMARY:**
```
**************************************
* Summary of aircraft gate selection *
**************************************
** flight number                      **: [flight_number]
** aircraft type                      **: [aircraft_type]
** gate id                            **: [gate_id]
** deplaning equipment type           **: [deplaning_equipment_type]
** deplaning equipment id             **: [deplaning_equipment_id]
** deplaning equipment readiness time **: [deplaning_equipment_readiness_time]
** deplaning equipment score          **: [deplaning_equipment_score]
```

---

#### BRANCH B — Jetbridge or stairtruck connection

**Trigger:** Called as STEP 9 by `aircraft_turnaround_manager` with `instruction='Connect the jetbridge.'` or `instruction='Connect the stairtruck.'`.

**STEP 1 — Determine deplaning equipment type (from args, NOT TrackerAPI):**

The instructions include a documented rationale for avoiding TrackerAPI here:
> *"CRITICAL: Read deplaning_equipment_type DIRECTLY from the incoming args. Do NOT call TrackerAPI to resolve this — TrackerAPI may not yet have the value and will return null, causing incorrect routing. The manager always passes deplaning_equipment_type as a named parameter."*

Resolution order:
1. If `deplaning_equipment_type` (from args) contains `'jetway'` or `'jetbridge'` → STEP 2A
2. If `deplaning_equipment_type` (from args) contains `'stairtruck'` or `'stair'` → STEP 2B
3. If null/absent, check `instruction`: `'jetbridge'` → STEP 2A, `'stairtruck'` → STEP 2B
4. Otherwise → default to STEP 2A (jetbridge)

**STEP 2A — Connect jetbridge (jetway gate):**
Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_jetbridge_connect` with: `flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `acu_connection_status`, `gpu_connection_status`, `wheelchocks_installation_status`. Single isolated call. Extract `jetbridge_connection_status`. Call `TrackerAPI` to store it.

**STEP 2B — Connect stairtruck (stairtruck gate):**
Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_stairtruck_connect` with the same parameter set. Extract `stairtruck_connection_status`. Call `TrackerAPI` to store it.

**RETURN SUMMARY A (jetbridge):**
```
***********************************
* Summary of jetbridge connection *
***********************************
** flight_status                  **: [flight_status]
** acu_connection_status          **: [acu_connection_status]
** gpu_connection_status          **: [gpu_connection_status]
** wheelchocks installation status**: [wheelchocks_installation_status]
** jetbridge_connection_status    **: [jetbridge_connection_status]
```

**RETURN SUMMARY B (stairtruck):**
```
************************************
* Summary of stairtruck connection *
************************************
** flight_status                  **: [flight_status]
** acu_connection_status          **: [acu_connection_status]
** gpu_connection_status          **: [gpu_connection_status]
** wheelchocks installation status**: [wheelchocks_installation_status]
** stairtruck_connection_status   **: [stairtruck_connection_status]
```

#### sly_data contract

All four directions carry the same 17-field set:

`flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `engines_stop_status`, `door_opening_status`, `passenger_disembarkation_status`, `jetbridge_connection_status`, `stairtruck_connection_status`, `deplaning_equipment_type`, `deplaning_equipment_id`, `gpu_connection_status`, `gpu_readiness_status`, `acu_connection_status`, `acu_readiness_status`, `wheelchocks_readiness_status`, `wheelchocks_installation_status`

> Note: `gpu_readiness_status` and `wheelchocks_installation_status` are in the sly_data allow blocks but **absent from `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS`** in Python. They propagate through sly_data channels between networks but TrackerAPI will not track or echo them.

> Note: `task_id` is **not** in the sly_data allow blocks — unlike `aircraft_crew_pilot` which threads `task_id` through all directions. This network does not use the correlation token pattern.

### 5.2 TrackerAPI (Coded Tool)

**Class:** `AirlineTurnaround.aircraft_gate_services.aircraft_gate_services.TrackerAPI`

Standard sly_data-first implementation. Called in BRANCH A STEP 1 after gate selection, and in BRANCH B STEP 2A or 2B after equipment connection.

#### Data resolution priority

1. **`sly_data[field]`** — authoritative; returned immediately if present.
2. **`args[field]`** — used only when `sly_data` has no value; promoted into `sly_data`.
3. **Neither** — logged as `NOT_FOUND`, returned as `None`.

#### Configuration (21 tracked fields = 21 return fields)

`acu_readiness_status`, `aircraft_direction`, `aircraft_type`, `assigned_runway_id`, `assigned_runway_length`, `clearance_type`, `door_opening_status`, `flight_number`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `ground_clearance_status`, `ground_clearance_type`, `jetbridge_connection_status`, `passenger_disembarkation_status`, `wheelchocks_readiness_status`, `engines_stop_status`, `deplaning_equipment_type`, `deplaning_equipment_id`, `gpu_connection_status`, `acu_connection_status`, `stairtruck_connection_status`

> Note: Tracked fields and return fields are identical — TrackerAPI returns everything it tracks.

> Note: `gpu_readiness_status` is in the HOCON TrackerAPI parameter schema (exposed to the LLM) and in the sly_data allow blocks, but **absent from Python `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS`**. The LLM can pass it, it will be ignored by TrackerAPI, and it won't be returned.

> Note: `wheelchocks_installation_status` is in the sly_data allow blocks and the HOCON TrackerAPI schema but **absent from Python tracked fields** — same gap.

> Note: The HOCON TrackerAPI description contains `"wheels_chucks_installation_status"` — the double-`c` copy-paste typo seen in multiple other networks.

> Note: `"required": []` is correctly defined.

## 9. Known Issues and Maintenance Notes

| Issue | Location | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| `"responsibke"` typo in agent description | `aircraft_gate_services.hocon` line 93 | Low | Should be `"responsible"`. |
| `gpu_readiness_status` and `wheelchocks_installation_status` not in Python tracked fields | `aircraft_gate_services.py` lines 426–448 | Low | Both are in HOCON sly_data allow blocks and TrackerAPI schema but absent from `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS`. Not persisted or returned by TrackerAPI. |
| `deplaning_equipment_readiness_time` and `deplaning_equipment_score` extracted but not tracked | `aircraft_gate_services.hocon` BRANCH A STEP 1 | Low | These are extracted from gate selection response and appear in the summary template, but are not in Python tracked fields. They will not be persisted in sly_data across calls. |
| HOCON TrackerAPI description `"wheels_chucks_installation_status"` typo | `aircraft_gate_services.hocon` line 384 | Low | Double-`c` typo. Same artifact in multiple other networks. |
| ~145-line commented-out `execute_aircraft_landing` class | `aircraft_gate_services.py` lines 28–143 | Low | Identical block in five other network Python files. Dead code. |
| Unused imports: `fcntl`, `asyncio`, `random`, `os`, `platform` | `aircraft_gate_services.py` lines 7–12 | Low | All unused. `fcntl` Unix-only, fails on Windows. |
| HOCON filename has `__1_` suffix | filename | Low | `aircraft_gate_services__1_.hocon` suggests a versioning/download artifact. Deployed filename should be `aircraft_gate_services.hocon`. |
| BRANCH B default to STEP 2A when equipment type unknown | `aircraft_gate_services.hocon` BRANCH B STEP 1 | Low | If both `deplaning_equipment_type` and `instruction` are ambiguous, the agent defaults to jetbridge. This could silently connect the wrong equipment type at a stairtruck-only gate. |

## 10. Comparison with Sibling Aggregation Networks

`aircraft_gate_services` is one of four aggregation networks under `aircraft_turnaround_manager`. Here's how it compares to the others:

| Aspect | `aircraft_gate_services` | `aircraft_cabin_services` | `aircraft_ground_operation` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entry agent name | `gate_crew_agent` | `cabin_services` | *(not yet documented)* |
| Routing discriminant | `instruction` + `gate_id` presence | `instruction` | `instruction` |
| Number of branches | 2 (A: assignment; B: connection with 2A/2B sub-paths) | 3 (clean/lavatory/catering) | 3+ (readiness/ramp/baggage/inspection/fueling) |
| TrackerAPI avoidance | Yes — BRANCH B STEP 1 | No | Yes — multiple steps |
| Tracked fields | 21 | 7 | *(not yet documented)* |
| Execution limits | 40,000 / 7,200s | 3,000 / 300s | 40,000 / 7,200s |
| TrackerAPI class path | Correct | Wrong module | *(not yet documented)* |

## 11. Extensibility Guidance

- Add `deplaning_equipment_readiness_time`, `deplaning_equipment_score`, `gpu_readiness_status`, and `wheelchocks_installation_status` to `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS` if these values need to persist across calls
- Fix the `"responsibke"` typo in the agent description
- Fix the `"wheels_chucks_installation_status"` typo in the TrackerAPI description
- Remove the commented-out `execute_aircraft_landing` class from the Python file
- Remove unused imports (`fcntl`, `asyncio`, `random`, `os`, `platform`)
- Add a fallback error when both `deplaning_equipment_type` and `instruction` are ambiguous in BRANCH B (instead of silently defaulting to jetbridge)
