# Aircraft Taxiing
## Agentic AI Network – README

> **Configuration file:** `aircraft_taxiing.hocon`
> **Implementation file:** `aircraft_taxiing.py`
> **Framework:** neuro-san (aaosa)
> **Primary use case:** Execute the complete taxi-in sequence for a landed aircraft — obtaining ground clearance, verifying ground equipment readiness, then taxiing to the assigned gate and setting `flight_status = 'on blocks'`.

---

## 1. Overview

`aircraft_taxiing` is one of the most architecturally sophisticated networks in the AirlineTurnaround system. It integrates three external networks (ground traffic, ground readiness), two LLM agents, and a coded execution tool into a single coordinated sequence, with carefully engineered `flight_status` normalisation to handle verbose LLM phrases.

The network combines:

- `aircraft_taxi_manager` — LLM orchestrator; entry point, coordinates all four steps
- `aircraft_taxiing_agent` — HOCON name for the coded class `execute_aircraft_taxiing`
- `execute_aircraft_taxiing` — coded tool; normalises flight_status and sets `'on blocks'` on successful taxiing
- `TrackerAPI` — coded tool with extended `_normalise_field` logic for flight_status canonicalisation
- Two external networks: `aircraft_ground_traffic` (ground clearance) and `aircraft_ground_readiness` (equipment readiness)

A comment in the Python file (line 30) dates the current implementation to post-20260123, noting it addresses "inconsistent behaviour of the previous version."

> **Important note on previous documentation:** The old doc described a flat `aircraft_taxiing_agent` → `taxiing_operator` structure. The actual entry point is `aircraft_taxi_manager`. There is no `taxiing_operator`, no `taxi_status` field, no `assigned_route`, and no conflict detection. The network's core innovation is `flight_status` normalisation, which the old doc did not mention at all.

## 5. Components

### 5.1 aircraft_taxi_manager (LLM Orchestrator — Entry Point)

The top-level agent. It verifies flight status, obtains ground clearance, checks ground equipment readiness, then delegates the actual taxiing to `aircraft_taxiing_agent` (the coded tool).

> Note: The true entry point is `aircraft_taxi_manager`. `aircraft_taxiing_agent` in the HOCON is the name given to the coded tool `execute_aircraft_taxiing` — not an LLM orchestrator. The previous documentation called the orchestrator `aircraft_taxiing_agent`, which now names the coded tool.

#### Input parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| `flight_number` | string | ✅ | Flight identifier |
| `aircraft_type` | string | ✅ | Aircraft model/type |
| `flight_status` | string | ✅ | Expected: contains `landed`, `taxi`, or `blocks` |
| `gate_id` | string | ✅ | Destination gate |
| `ground_clearance_type` | string | ❌ | e.g. `taxi in` or `taxi out` |
| `ground_clearance_status` | string | ❌ | Expected: contains `clear` or `grant` |
| `wheelchocks_readiness_status` | string | ❌ | From `aircraft_ground_readiness` |
| `acu_readiness_status` | string | ❌ | From `aircraft_ground_readiness` |
| `gpu_readiness_status` | string | ❌ | From `aircraft_ground_readiness` |

#### Orchestration flow (STEP pattern)

**STEP 1 — Verify flight status:**
`flight_status` must contain `'landed'`, `'taxi'`, or `'blocks'`. If not → stop and report.

**STEP 2 — Resolve ground clearance (ONE call maximum):**
If `ground_clearance_status` already contains `'clear'` or `'grant'` → skip to STEP 3. Otherwise call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_ground_traffic` once with all parameters and `ground_clearance_type='taxi in'`. Wait. Store results. If clearance not granted → stop and report failure.

**STEP 3 — Resolve ground services readiness (ONE call, non-blocking):**
Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_ground_readiness` once with `aircraft_type`, `gate_id`. Wait. Extract and store the three readiness statuses via `TrackerAPI`. **Continue to STEP 4 regardless of readiness values.** Report any unready items in the summary only.

**STEP 4 — Execute taxiing:**
Call `aircraft_taxiing_agent` with all parameters. Wait for response.
- The response string IS the new `flight_status` value.
- If response contains `'on blocks'` or `'block'` → taxiing succeeded.
- Otherwise → report failure: `"STEP 4 FAILED: taxiing did not complete."`
- **Do NOT call TrackerAPI after this step.**

The instructions explain the reason in detail: the taxiing coded tool has already written `flight_status='on blocks'` into sly_data directly. Reading TrackerAPI would risk returning the stale incoming `flight_status` that was present before taxiing ran.

**RETURN SUMMARY:** `flight_status` is hardcoded as `'on blocks'` in the summary template — the instructions explicitly say "Write this hardcoded value into the summary. Do NOT substitute a variable."

> Note: STEP 3 is **non-blocking** — ground equipment readiness is checked informatively and does not gate the taxi execution. This is a deliberate design choice: the aircraft can taxi even if ACU/GPU/chocks are not yet confirmed ready, but those unready items are flagged in the summary. This differs from the jetbridge/stairtruck networks where readiness is a hard gate.

#### sly_data contract

All four directions carry the same 10-field set:

`aircraft_type`, `flight_number`, `flight_status`, `ground_clearance_type`, `ground_clearance_status`, `gate_id`, `assigned_runway_id`, `acu_readiness_status`, `gpu_readiness_status`, `wheelchocks_readiness_status`

#### Down-chain tools

```
["aircraft_taxiing_agent", "TrackerAPI",
 "/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_ground_readiness",
 "/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_ground_traffic"]
```

---

### 5.2 aircraft_taxiing_agent / execute_aircraft_taxiing (Coded Tool)

**HOCON name:** `aircraft_taxiing_agent`
**Python class:** `AirlineTurnaround.aircraft_taxiing.aircraft_taxiing.execute_aircraft_taxiing`

The coded execution tool. It reads all parameters using the `_from_sly_or_args` helper (sly_data-first), applies the `flight_status` normalisation pipeline, evaluates the taxiing condition, and returns the final `flight_status` string.

#### `flight_status` normalisation (in-tool)

A canonical normalisation is applied before any condition check:

```python
if 'land' in flight_status:   → 'landed'
elif 'taxi' in flight_status: → 'taxiing'
elif 'block' in flight_status:→ 'on blocks'
```

The normalised value is immediately written back to `sly_data["flight_status"]`. This prevents verbose LLM-extracted phrases like `"landed on runway 19R"` from propagating to downstream agents that expect `'landed'`.

#### Input parameters (sly_data-first via `_from_sly_or_args`)

| Parameter | Required | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| `flight_number` | ✅ | |
| `aircraft_type` | ✅ | |
| `flight_status` | ✅ | Normalised before use |
| `gate_id` | ✅ | |
| `assigned_runway_id` | ✅ | |
| `ground_clearance_type` | ✅ | Lowercased before use |
| `ground_clearance_status` | ✅ | Lowercased before use |
| `gpu_readiness_status` | ✅ | Read but not used in condition |
| `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` | ✅ | Read but not used in condition |
| `acu_readiness_status` | ✅ | Read but not used in condition |

> Note: Only `flight_status` and `ground_clearance_status` influence the taxiing condition. The three readiness statuses (`gpu_readiness_status`, `wheels_chocks_readiness_status`, `acu_readiness_status`) are read and printed but play no role in whether taxiing proceeds — consistent with STEP 3 being non-blocking.

#### Taxiing condition

```python
if (('land' in flight_status OR 'taxi' in flight_status)
    AND ('clear' in ground_clearance_status OR 'grant' in ground_clearance_status)):
    flight_status = 'on blocks'
```

Both flight status keywords (`'land'`, `'taxi'`) and clearance keywords (`'clear'`, `'grant'`) use substring matching. Note: after the in-tool normalisation, `flight_status` will already be `'landed'` or `'taxiing'`, so these are effectively checking the canonical tokens.

#### Output

- If condition met: writes `flight_status = 'on blocks'` into `sly_data`; returns `'on blocks'`; appends log entry
- If condition not met: returns the normalised `flight_status` string without updating sly_data (the value set by normalisation on line 129 remains in sly_data)
- Returns `flight_status` string in all cases — not a structured dict

> Note: The log message on line 289 contains a typo: `"has taied to gate"` — should be `"has taxied to gate"`.

> Note: Class-level `print()` statements at lines 38–44 execute at **import time**, not per invocation. The banner `"EXECUTE AIRCRAFT TAXIING CALLED FOR AIRCRAFT TAXIING"` appears once on module load.

---

### 5.3 TrackerAPI (Coded Tool — Extended with Normalisation)

**Class:** `AirlineTurnaround.aircraft_taxiing.aircraft_taxiing.TrackerAPI`

This TrackerAPI extends the standard sly_data-first implementation with a `_normalise_field` method that canonicalises `flight_status` values on both read and write. This is the only TrackerAPI in the system with field normalisation logic.

#### Normalisation logic

On every read or write of `flight_status`:
- `"land"` in value → `"landed"`
- `"block"` in value → `"on blocks"`
- Mid-transit values like `"TAXIING_IN"` are NOT mapped (left as-is)

The docstring explains: *"the taxiing coded tool sets flight_status='on blocks' directly when taxiing completes."*

#### Configuration

**Tracked fields:**
`acu_readiness_status`, `aircraft_direction`, `aircraft_type`, `assigned_runway_id`, `flight_number`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `gpu_readiness_status`, `ground_clearance_status`, `ground_clearance_type`, `wheels_chocks_readiness_status`

**Return fields:** Identical to tracked fields (all 11 returned).

> Note: The TrackerAPI HOCON schema uses `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` (with underscore between "wheels" and "chocks"). The `aircraft_taxi_manager` agent schema uses `wheelchocks_readiness_status` (no underscore). These are different field names — the orchestrator and TrackerAPI use different keys for the same concept.

> Note: `aircraft_direction` is tracked and returned by TrackerAPI but is absent from the HOCON agent parameter schemas and sly_data allow blocks.

> Note: Class-level `print()` statements at lines 369–375 execute at **import time** — banner `"TRACKER API CALLED FOR AIRCRAFT TAXIING"` prints once on module load.

> Note: The HOCON `TrackerAPI` definition correctly includes `"required": []`.

## 6. External Tool Dependencies

| Tool path | Purpose | Step | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_ground_traffic` | Request and confirm ground clearance | STEP 2 | Yes — clearance failure stops the workflow |
| `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_ground_readiness` | Check ACU/GPU/chocks readiness at gate | STEP 3 | No — workflow continues regardless |

---

## 7. Field Naming Inconsistency — Wheelchocks Readiness

Three different field names for wheelchocks readiness appear across this network:

| Location | Field name used |
|---|---|
| `aircraft_taxi_manager` agent schema | `wheelchocks_readiness_status` |
| `aircraft_taxiing_agent` (`execute_aircraft_taxiing`) schema `required` | `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` |
| TrackerAPI Python tracked/return fields | `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` |
| TrackerAPI HOCON schema | `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` |
| HOCON sly_data allow blocks | `wheelchocks_readiness_status` |

The manager and sly_data blocks use `wheelchocks_readiness_status`; the coded tool and TrackerAPI use `wheels_chocks_readiness_status`. Values written under one name will not be found when the other name is looked up.

## 8. Sample Queries

```
# Full information provided
"The B747 aircraft of flight AF84 has landed on runway 19R. The clearance to taxi in
has been granted. The ground power unit, the air conditioning unit and the wheelchocks
are ready. Please taxi the plane to gate A1."
```

---

## 9. Example Execution Trace

**Input:**
> "The B747 aircraft of flight AF84 has landed on runway 19R. The clearance to taxi in has been granted. The GPU, ACU, and wheelchocks are ready. Please taxi the plane to gate A1."

**Execution steps:**

1. STEP 1: `flight_status` contains `'landed'` ✅
2. STEP 2: `ground_clearance_status` contains `'grant'` ✅ — skip `aircraft_ground_traffic` call
3. STEP 3: `aircraft_ground_readiness` called → `acu_readiness_status=ready`, `gpu_readiness_status=ready`, `wheelchocks_readiness_status=ready`. `TrackerAPI` stores them.
4. STEP 4: `aircraft_taxiing_agent` (`execute_aircraft_taxiing`) called. Flight status normalised `'landed'` → condition met → `flight_status = 'on blocks'`. Returns `'on blocks'`.
5. Summary returned (TrackerAPI NOT called after STEP 4)

**Output:**

```
*******************************
* Summary of aircraft taxiing *
*******************************
** flight number           **: AF84
** aircraft type           **: B747
** gate id                 **: A1
** assigned runway id      **: 19R
** ground clearance type   **: taxi in
** ground clearance status **: granted
** ACU readiness           **: ready
** GPU readiness           **: ready
** wheelchocks readiness   **: ready
** flight status           **: on blocks
```

## 10. Known Issues and Maintenance Notes

| Issue | Location | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| **`wheelchocks_readiness_status` vs `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` naming inconsistency** | HOCON agent schema vs. Python TrackerAPI fields | **High** | Two different sly_data keys for the same concept. Values will not be shared between manager and TrackerAPI unless one spelling is standardised across all locations. |
| Agent name mismatch with prior documentation | `aircraft_taxiing.hocon` lines 88, 276 | Low | Entry point is `aircraft_taxi_manager`; prior doc called the orchestrator `aircraft_taxiing_agent`. That name now refers to the coded tool wrapper. |
| Class-level `print()` in `execute_aircraft_taxiing` | `aircraft_taxiing.py` lines 38–44 | Low | Executes at import time, not per invocation. Banner prints once on module load. |
| Class-level `print()` in `TrackerAPI` | `aircraft_taxiing.py` lines 369–375 | Low | Same issue — prints at module load. |
| Log message typo `"taied"` | `aircraft_taxiing.py` line 289 | Low | Should be `"taxied"`. |
| `aircraft_direction` tracked by TrackerAPI but absent from agent schema and sly_data allow blocks | `aircraft_taxiing.py` line 639 | Low | The field will be in TrackerAPI's config but no agent parameter produces it. |
| Ground equipment readiness is non-blocking (by design) | `aircraft_taxiing.hocon` STEP 3 | Info | ACU/GPU/chocks not-ready does not prevent taxiing. This is a documented design decision. Consider whether it aligns with operational requirements. |
| `'block'` substring in STEP 1 and normalisation | `aircraft_taxiing.hocon` line 150; `aircraft_taxiing.py` line 125 | Low | Matches `"unblocked"`, `"roadblock"`, etc. The canonical normalisation mitigates most risk by mapping first-match. |
| STEP 4 prohibits TrackerAPI call — documented rationale | `aircraft_taxiing.hocon` lines 184–188 | Info | Documented and intentional. Do not add a TrackerAPI read after STEP 4 without understanding the stale-state risk. |

## 11. Key Differences from Prior Documentation

| Aspect | Old documentation | Actual implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Entry-point agent name | `aircraft_taxiing_agent` | `aircraft_taxi_manager` |
| Coded tool name | `taxiing_operator` | `execute_aircraft_taxiing` |
| Output field | `taxi_status` | `flight_status` (updated to `'on blocks'`) |
| Conflict detection | Described | Does not exist |
| Assigned route returned | Yes (`["RWY-27", ...]`) | Does not exist |
| External dependencies | None described | `aircraft_ground_traffic` + `aircraft_ground_readiness` |
| `flight_status` normalisation | Not mentioned | Core feature; documented in both operator and TrackerAPI |
| Ground equipment readiness | Not mentioned | STEP 3 — checked non-blockingly |
| Post-20260123 version note | Not mentioned | Line 30 comment documents the implementation date and motivation |

## 12. Extensibility Guidance

- Standardise `wheelchocks_readiness_status` vs `wheels_chocks_readiness_status` across all four locations: agent schema, coded tool schema `required`, TrackerAPI Python fields, and sly_data allow blocks
- Remove the class-level `print()` statements from both `execute_aircraft_taxiing` and `TrackerAPI` (move banners inside `invoke()` or remove entirely)
- Fix the log message typo `"taied"` → `"taxied"`
- Add `aircraft_direction` to the sly_data allow blocks if it needs to propagate
