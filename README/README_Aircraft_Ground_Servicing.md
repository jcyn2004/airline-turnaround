# Aircraft Ground Servicing
## Agentic AI Network – README

> **Configuration file:** `aircraft_ground_servicing.hocon`
> **Implementation file:** `aircraft_ground_servicing.py`
> **Framework:** neuro-san (aaosa)
> **Primary use case:** Route a ground servicing request to one of three service branches — baggage unloading, inspection/maintenance, or fueling — based on an explicit `instruction` field, then execute the selected service via its dedicated external network.

---

## 1. Overview

`aircraft_ground_servicing` is a **branch-routing dispatcher** in the **AirlineTurnaround** agentic system. Unlike most other networks that execute a single service, this network reads an `instruction` field and routes to exactly one of three downstream service networks per invocation. It acts as a unified entry point for the three turnaround services most dependent on human-clearance prerequisites.

The network combines:

- An LLM-based routing agent (`servicing_crew_agent`) that reads the `instruction` field, selects the correct branch, and executes it
- A shared state manager (`TrackerAPI`) also implemented in Python
- Three external tool references (`aircraft_baggage_unload`, `aircraft_inspection_maintenance`, `aircraft_fueling`) resolved from the shared registry `registries/aaosa_basic.hocon`

A critical architectural distinction is the TrackerAPI implementation in this network: it uses **`args`-first** resolution (not `sly_data`-first), with an explicit docstring explaining the rationale. This is the only TrackerAPI in the system with this priority order and the only one with documented design reasoning for its field resolution strategy.

### Design principles

- **Instruction-based routing:** The `instruction` parameter is the routing key. The agent reads it first and selects exactly one branch. If no branch matches, the agent reports not relevant.
- **Branch isolation:** Each branch executes its steps independently. Once a branch is matched, the agent is explicitly instructed not to evaluate or execute steps from other branches.
- **Validation-before-reporting:** All three branches include a `VALIDATION` step requiring the returned status to contain a specific value before success is declared. The agent must not fabricate completion.
- **TrackerAPI called last in each branch:** Unlike most orchestrators that call TrackerAPI first, the instructions for all three branches call the external service network first, then call TrackerAPI to persist the result. Branch A adds a `CRITICAL: Do NOT call TrackerAPI before executing` warning.
- **args-first TrackerAPI:** This network's `TrackerAPI` resolves `args` before `sly_data`, with documented rationale — new values from the current operation must overwrite prior accumulated state.

## 5. Components

### 5.1 servicing_crew_agent (LLM Branch Router)

The entry-point agent. It reads the `instruction` field, matches it to a branch, and executes that branch's single service step plus validation and summary.

#### Input parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| `flight_number` | string | ✅ | Flight identifier |
| `aircraft_type` | string | ✅ | Aircraft model/type |
| `flight_status` | string | ✅ | Flight status |
| `gate_id` | string | ❌ | Gate where the aircraft is parked |
| `instruction` | string | ❌ | Routing key: `'baggage'`/`'unload'`, `'inspection'`/`'maintenance'`, or `'fuel'`/`'fueling'`/`'refuel'` |
| `jetbridge_connection_status` | string | ❌ | For Branch A |
| `stairtruck_connection_status` | string | ❌ | For Branch A |
| `door_opening_status` | string | ❌ | For Branch A |
| `passenger_disembarkation_status` | string | ❌ | For Branches B and C |
| `crew_exit_status` | string | ❌ | For Branches B and C |
| `baggage_unload_status` | string | ❌ | For Branches B and C |
| `inspection_maintenance_status` | string | ❌ | For Branch B output |
| `fueling_status` | string | ❌ | For Branch C output |

> Note: `clearance_type` appears **twice** in the HOCON agent parameter schema (lines 115 and 131). The duplicate is harmless at runtime but should be deduplicated.

#### Branch routing logic

| `instruction` contains | Branch | External network called |
|---|---|---|
| `'baggage'` or `'unload'` | **Branch A** | `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_baggage_unload` |
| `'inspection'` or `'maintenance'` | **Branch B** | `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_inspection_maintenance` |
| `'fuel'`, `'fueling'`, or `'refuel'` | **Branch C** | `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_fueling` |
| No match | — | Agent replies not relevant and stops |

Branch A has highest routing priority and is checked first. If `instruction` contains `'baggage'` or `'unload'`, Branch A MUST execute regardless of other content in `instruction`.

#### Branch A — Baggage Unloading

1. `CRITICAL: Do NOT call TrackerAPI first.` Read all prerequisite values directly from incoming args.
2. Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_baggage_unload` with `flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `jetbridge_connection_status`, `stairtruck_connection_status`, `door_opening_status`. Wait.
3. **VALIDATION:** `baggage_unload_status` must contain `'completed'` or `'unloaded'`. If not → report failure.
4. Call `TrackerAPI` to store `baggage_unload_status`.
5. Return summary.

#### Branch B — Inspection and Maintenance

1. Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_inspection_maintenance` with `flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `passenger_disembarkation_status`, `crew_exit_status`, `baggage_unload_status`. Wait.
2. **VALIDATION:** `inspection_maintenance_status` must contain `'completed'`. If not → report failure.
3. Call `TrackerAPI` to store `inspection_maintenance_status`.
4. Return summary.

#### Branch C — Fueling

1. Call `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_fueling` with `flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `gate_id`, `passenger_disembarkation_status`, `crew_exit_status`, `baggage_unload_status`. Wait.
2. **VALIDATION:** `fueling_status` must contain `'completed'`. If not → report failure with raw response.
3. Call `TrackerAPI` to store `fueling_status`.
4. Return summary (with note: "IMPORTANT: Use this exact template").

#### sly_data contract

All four directions carry the same 21-field set — the broadest symmetric contract in the system:

`flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `ground_clearance_type`, `gate_id`, `assigned_runway_id`, `assigned_runway_length`, `wheelchocks_readiness_status`, `acu_readiness_status`, `gpu_readiness_status`, `aircraft_direction`, `clearance_type`, `engines_stop_status`, `door_opening_status`, `jetbridge_connection_status`, `stairtruck_connection_status`, `deplaning_equipment_type`, `passenger_disembarkation_status`, `crew_exit_status`, `baggage_unload_status`, `inspection_maintenance_status`, `fueling_status`

#### Down-chain tools

```
["/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_baggage_unload",
 "/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_inspection_maintenance",
 "/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_fueling",
 "TrackerAPI"]
```

### 5.2 TrackerAPI (Coded Tool) — Args-First Implementation

**Class:** `AirlineTurnaround.aircraft_ground_servicing.aircraft_ground_servicing.TrackerAPI`

This is the **only TrackerAPI in the system that uses `args`-first resolution**. All other TrackerAPI instances prefer `sly_data`. The docstring explains the design decision:

> *"args carries the current operation's output (e.g. fueling_status from the fueling agent). sly_data carries prior state. If we always preferred sly_data, a completed inspection from STEP 18 would silently block the fueling write in STEP 19, causing the agent to return the wrong branch summary."*

#### Data resolution priority

1. **`args[field]`** — authoritative for writes; always wins. Value is immediately written to `sly_data`.
2. **`sly_data[field]`** — read existing state when `args` has no value for the field.
3. **Neither** — logged as `NOT_FOUND`, returned as `None`.

This is the **inverse** of the standard priority used by all other TrackerAPI implementations in the system.

#### Configuration

`TrackerAPI` is configuration-driven via a `TrackerConfig` dataclass, resolved in this order: `args['_config']` → `sly_data['_tracker_config']` → default config (lazy-initialized once per request).

The default configuration for this network is the broadest TrackerAPI config in the system:

**Tracked fields (20):**
`flight_number`, `aircraft_type`, `flight_status`, `ground_clearance_type`, `gate_id`, `assigned_runway_id`, `assigned_runway_length`, `wheelchocks_readiness_status`, `acu_readiness_status`, `gpu_readiness_status`, `aircraft_direction`, `clearance_type`, `engines_stop_status`, `door_opening_status`, `jetbridge_connection_status`, `passenger_disembarkation_status`, `crew_exit_status`, `baggage_unload_status`, `inspection_maintenance_status`, `fueling_status`

**Return fields:** Identical to tracked fields (all 20 returned).

> Note: `inspection_maintenance_status` is tracked and returned by the Python TrackerAPI but is absent from the HOCON `TrackerAPI` parameters schema. The HOCON schema does not expose this field to the LLM, though the Python will track it from sly_data if present.

> Note: `stairtruck_connection_status` and `deplaning_equipment_type` appear in the sly_data allow blocks but are not in `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS`. TrackerAPI will not track or return them.

> Note: The HOCON `TrackerAPI` description still references stale fields: `"wheels_chucks_installation_status"` (double typo). Neither is tracked by this network.

> Note: The HOCON `TrackerAPI` definition correctly includes `"required": []`.

## 6. External Tool Dependencies

These tools are resolved at runtime from `registries/aaosa_basic.hocon`:

| Tool path | Branch | Trigger keywords |
|---|---|---|
| `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_baggage_unload` | A | `'baggage'`, `'unload'` |
| `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_inspection_maintenance` | B | `'inspection'`, `'maintenance'` |
| `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_fueling` | C | `'fuel'`, `'fueling'`, `'refuel'` |

## 7. Sample Queries

```
# Branch A
"The B747 aircraft of flight AF84 is on blocks at gate A1.
The plane has been connected to the jetbridge. The aircraft door is open.
Unload baggages."

# Branch B
"The B747 aircraft of flight AF84 is on blocks at gate A1.
Baggages have been unloaded. All passengers have disembarked.
The crew has exited the aircraft. Perform inspection and maintenance."

# Branch C
"The B747 aircraft of flight AF84 is on blocks at gate A1.
Baggages have been unloaded. All passengers have disembarked.
The crew has exited the aircraft. Perform the fueling of the aircraft."
```

---

## 8. Example Execution Trace (Branch C — Fueling)

**Input:**
> "The B747 aircraft of flight AF84 is on blocks at gate A1. Baggages have been unloaded. All passengers have disembarked. The crew has exited the aircraft. Perform the fueling of the aircraft."

**Execution steps:**

1. `instruction` matched to Branch C (`'fuel'`/`'fueling'` detected)
2. `/AirlineTurnaround/aircraft_fueling` called with all parameters
3. Validation: `fueling_status=completed` ✅
4. `TrackerAPI` called — stores `fueling_status=completed`
5. Summary returned

**Output:**

```
*******************************
* Summary of aircraft fueling *
*******************************
** flight status                    **: on blocks
** passenger disembarkation status  **: completed
** crew exit status                 **: exited
** baggage unload status            **: completed
** fueling status summary           **: completed
```

## 9. Known Issues and Maintenance Notes

| Issue | Location | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| `clearance_type` declared twice in agent parameters | `aircraft_ground_servicing.hocon` lines 115 and 131 | Low | Duplicate property definition in the agent schema. The second declaration overrides the first. Remove one. |
| `inspection_maintenance_status` absent from HOCON TrackerAPI schema | `aircraft_ground_servicing.hocon` TrackerAPI parameters | Low | Tracked by Python but not exposed in the HOCON schema. LLM-facing descriptions for this field are missing. |
| `stairtruck_connection_status` and `deplaning_equipment_type` in sly_data but not in Python tracked fields | HOCON allow blocks vs. `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS` | Low | Both fields propagate through sly_data allow blocks but TrackerAPI will not persist or return them. |
| Module-level diagnostic `print()` and `sys.path` output | `aircraft_ground_servicing.py` lines 25–27 | Low | `print("Python path:", sys.path)`, `print("Current file:", __file__)`, `print("Package:", __package__)` execute at import time on every module load. Should be removed for production. |
| HOCON TrackerAPI description references `wheels_chucks_installation_status` | `aircraft_ground_servicing.hocon` line 432 | Low | Stale copy-paste artifact. Neither field is tracked by this network. |
| Branch A warning about TrackerAPI ordering | `aircraft_ground_servicing.hocon` Branch A instructions | Info | The `CRITICAL: Do NOT call TrackerAPI before executing` instruction is unique to Branch A and absent from Branches B and C, which do not make the same stipulation. This is likely intentional given Branch A depends on sly_data state that should come from args, not be overwritten by a prior TrackerAPI read. |

## 10. Relationship to Other Networks

`aircraft_ground_servicing` acts as a single-call interface for three networks that could otherwise be called independently:

| Direct call | Via `aircraft_ground_servicing` |
|---|---|
| Call `aircraft_baggage_unload` directly | Pass `instruction='baggage'` |
| Call `aircraft_inspection_maintenance` directly | Pass `instruction='inspection'` |
| Call `aircraft_fueling` directly | Pass `instruction='fuel'` |

The primary value-add is the shared TrackerAPI with 20-field coverage, the instruction-routing dispatch, and the standardized validation + summary templates for all three services. Upstream orchestrators that need to trigger multiple services in sequence can call this network multiple times with different `instruction` values.

---

## 11. Key Architectural Differences from Other Networks

| Aspect | `aircraft_ground_servicing` | Typical network |
|---|---|---|
| TrackerAPI field resolution | `args`-first (write always wins) | `sly_data`-first (accumulated state wins) |
| Number of external services | 3 (routed by `instruction`) | 1 |
| TrackerAPI called | After service execution | Before and after |
| Branch A: TrackerAPI timing | Explicitly deferred to after service | Called at step 1 |
| Tracked field count | 20 (broadest non-master set) | 3–8 |
| TrackerAPI tracked = return | Yes | Varies |

---

## 12. Extensibility Guidance

- Add Branch D, E, etc. for additional services (cabin cleaning, catering loading, crew exit) by following the same BRANCH → STEP → VALIDATION → RETURN SUMMARY pattern
- Fix the `clearance_type` duplicate in the agent schema
- Add `inspection_maintenance_status` to the HOCON TrackerAPI parameters schema
- Add `stairtruck_connection_status` and `deplaning_equipment_type` to `FLIGHT_TURNAROUND_TRACKED_FIELDS` if they need to be persisted and returned
- Remove the module-level diagnostic `print()` and `sys.path` statements before production deployment
